                ,
                so you may use the Sites); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with
                applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our
                legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you, to ensure the security of our
                services, to communicate with you about our products and services); and based on consent by our
                customers
                (for example, to place certain cookies and to share your information with third parties for advertising
                purposes).<br>

                steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality, and we
                implement measures such as standard contractual clauses. A copy of those clauses can be obtained by

                Subject to limitations in applicable law, you are entitled to object to or request the restriction of
                processing of your Personal Data, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of
